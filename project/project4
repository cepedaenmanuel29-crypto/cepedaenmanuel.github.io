            <h2>Microgrid Definition</h2>

            <p>
                The Grid is an abstraction. It is a complete system of
                generators, distributors, and users of electric power throughout
                a large region like the eastern half of North America.
            </p>

            <p>
                A microgrid is a small version of a large electrical
                power network. If disconnected from the outside world, a
                microgrid continues to provide critical electrical services to
                its users.
            </p>

            <p>
                Smaller microgrids may be nested inside larger microgrids.
                Larger grids can obtain services from smaller components.
                This allows faster response to problems and better management.

            <h2>Typical Microgrid Features</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>High-efficiency lighting, appliances, and machinery.</li>
                <li>Local renewable energy sources and energy storage.</li>
                <li>A comprehensive energy-management control system.</li>
                <li>Ability to communicate with larger and smaller grid systems.</li>
                <li>Ability to disconnect from larger grids and continue operating.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Possible Microgrids in Lawrence</h2>

            <h3>Large Scale</h3>
            <p>The entire city of Lawrence could function as a microgrid.</p>

            <h3>Intermediate Scale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All buildings in downtown Lawrence.</li>
                <li>A group of industrial buildings and residences in East Lawrence.</li>
                <li>A group of medical buildings in Old West Lawrence.</li>
                <li>The University of Kansas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Small Scale</h3>
            <p>
                An individual industrial, institutional, commercial,
                or residential building could become a microgrid
                if it includes local energy generation and storage.
